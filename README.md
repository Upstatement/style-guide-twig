Upstatement Style Guide
================

Template for Twig/Timber

### What Is This?
A style guide starter theme that helps display typography, objects, and other design patterns. It’s templated using Twig & Timber for easy inclusion in our WordPress projects. 

The Style Guide is designed for easy use by our clients. It lets the designer *name components* and *write notes* about when to use them. It gives the client *code snips* that make it easy to copy, paste, and replicate our work.

### How Does it Work?

This package ships with some standard patterns (buttons, text styles, section headers, etc.) to help you get started. But nothing is set in stone. Delete anything you don’t want, replace anything the needs changing, and add custom components for your project. 

### What’s Included?

The files are …
* **Style Guide Source** *page-style-guide-source.twig*
 Contains This is where you’ll do most of your work. 

* **Style Guide Container** *page-style-guide.twig*
	- There should be no need to touch this file.
